alter database archivelog;
alter database open;
```
2. Set up CDC in the Oracle database.
```sql
 create tablespace SOURCE datafile '$ORACLE_PATH/oradata/Oracle/SOURCE.dbf' size 50M;
```
```sql
create user source
identified by source
default tablespace SOURCE 
quota unlimited on SOURCE
quota unlimited on SYSTEM
quota unlimited on SYSAUX;
```
```sql
grant connect, create table to source;
grant create tablespace to source;
grant unlimited tablespace to source;
grant select_catalog_role to source;
grant execute_catalog_role to source;
grant create sequence to source;
grant create session to source;
grant dba to source;
grant execute on SYS.DBMS_CDC_PUBLISH to source;
alter user source quota unlimited on users;
```
```sql
create tablespace PUBLISHER datafile '$ORACLE_PATH/oradata/Oracle/PUBLISHER.dbf' size 50M;
```
```sql
create user publisher
identified by publisher
default tablespace PUBLISHER
quota unlimited on PUBLISHER
quota unlimited on SYSTEM
quota unlimited on SYSAUX;
```
```sql
grant connect, create table to publisher;
grant create tablespace to publisher;
grant unlimited tablespace to publisher;
grant select_catalog_role to publisher;
grant execute_catalog_role to publisher;
grant create sequence to publisher;
grant create session to publisher;
grant dba to publisher;
grant execute on SYS.DBMS_CDC_PUBLISH to publisher;
execute DBMS_STREAMS_AUTH.GRANT_ADMIN_PRIVILEGE(GRANTEE=>'publisher');
```
3. Create and give all rights to the source user.
2. Create and give all rights to the publisher.
